Style Guide: Airbnb 
I followed the style guide through the use of ESLint, managed to get my total errors from 2000 ish. 

If the locations isn't working for you, i have found it works in some emulators and not others, just make sure its turned on in settings. 

Dark Mode Does Work: 
It was being slow in my screen cast due to recording at the same time, it works by testing the Async value of dark mode for true or false, whenever a page loads
and then sets the stylesheet dark / light accordingly. Default is light and you can change it in the settings page. 

There is also a button in the settings page that will close the app.
